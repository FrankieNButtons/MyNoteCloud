## Quizz Tips
- Notes can be used in doing quizz
- Solutions is released 1 day after the quizz endded, and the solution quizz will not be taken into consideration of the final score of this module.
## Definitions
### Null Hypothesis
a state of the world that you wish to disprove or check your data 
against
### Testable Hypothesis
### Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing Framework(NHST)

### Cumulative Distribution Function
- Has a Area under Curve equal to 1
- CDF(x) = P(X<=x)
### Porbability Density Function
- Has a realm between 0 and 1
- PDF(x) = P(X=x)
### Significance Level (Alpha)
- The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the  is true.


## Common Distributions
- Normal Distribution: A bell curve(with a PDF of $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$)
- Poisson Distribution: 
- Binomial Distribution:
